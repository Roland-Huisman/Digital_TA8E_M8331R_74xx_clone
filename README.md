# Digital_TA8E_M8331R_74xx_clone
This is a 74xx version of the TA8E controller for the TU60 Decassette. It's called the TA8E M8331R.

There are no DEC or SP chips used. Only 74xx and 74HCTxx series chips are used. It passes the MAINDEC-08-DHTAA-B TA8/E DIAGNOSTIC static test, control test and Data test.

I will do another run of the boards and place the gerbers when tested.

I hope to do some more redesigns of several Omnibus boards. Prices are getting insane and in this way you can build as many boards as you want to have. If you want to built these boards and sell them on Ebay, you are more then welcome to do that. In this way you can help other people to get these boards which probably are not able to solder them by them self.

All documents are profided as-is. I have to check which lisence is the best suitable for the project.

Regards, Roland
